# Purpose

Need to figure out lightweight way for researcher to explore different visualisations.

How to empower her to answer the questions she needs to answer. How to give her enough that she can explore her intuition? How do we scaffold this. 

## Output

She is comfortable with running R scripts, so I think an Rscript might be best, perhaps Rmarkdown. Quarto opens too much of a can of worms in installation. 

I'll write in Rmarkdown and see how we go. 

## Input 

I'd like her to be able to input her data and clean it as she inspects. 

I think it's okay for a first pass if  we just assume that the data is in a directory marked data. I'll write a readme saying not to push the data is in the .gitignore, while she's preparing for publication. 

Let's think about the best thing for her :) This is mvp for tomorrow's meeting.
